# Hello
Just experimenting

This is quite nice. Better than what I was expecting, git I mean...


Ok anyway, here are instructions:

CLone the repo in whatever folder u want.
install dependecies using poetry install.
Go to: [https://www.exchangerate-api.com/] and make you API key
Copy paste the API key into 'API_KEY' variables in the env_key file (inside src)
save all files
go to main.py
run.
Try to break it. 
It's just proof of concept, so not much asthetics.
