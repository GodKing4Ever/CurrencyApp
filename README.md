# Hello
Just experimenting

This is quite nice. Better than what I was expecting, git I mean...


Ok anyway, here are instructions:

Clone the repo in whatever folder u want.

install dependecies using poetry install.

Go to: [https://www.exchangerate-api.com/] and make you API key.

Copy paste the API key into 'API_KEY' variables in the env_key file (inside src).

Save all files.

Go to main.py

Run.

Try to break it. 

It's just proof of concept, so not much asthetics.
